# React-Redux Boilerplate

This Boilerplate is the base for React-Redux Websites. Additionial functionalities and code will be provided in the toolbox repository. The main sceleton was build according to [react-boilerplate tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-your-own-react-boilerplate-2f8cbbeb9b3f) by Nick Karnik. Great Thanks to him.

I updated the original tutorial devDependencies to webpack 4.x and babel 7.x

## Setup

Clone git repo then

    npm install
    npm run build
